# Warmur-Interview-MVC

MVC app built on .NET 8.

Bootstrap 4.5.3 and Jquery 3.6.0 are the other frameworks/libraries used in this project.

To run the project, open the solution in visual studio then build and start.

The index page will load all leads.  
You can click on each lead which will navigate to a dedicated lead view.
In the lead view you can add, update, or delete indicators.

	1. Error handling
